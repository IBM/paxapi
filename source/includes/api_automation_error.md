# Log automation activities and errors

Use the automation log to track automation activities and troubleshoot problems with automation tools and scripts. The automation log is automatically generated when you run an automation script.

The automation log is returned using a call to the Automation API function TraceLog. For information about the TraceLog function, see [TraceLog](#tracelog).
