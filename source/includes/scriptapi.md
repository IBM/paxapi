# Script files

This site includes sample script files that you can use to automate functions. The samples include script files for scheduling the refresh of documents. Also, there is a script file to update the server URL.

You must modify the script files to meet your particular needs or use them as a reference to create your own programs. For more information, see the comments in the file.

These Visual Basic Scripts (VBS) are provided as sample programs and are [here](https://github.com/IBM/paxapi/raw/master/attachments/Automation.zip):
